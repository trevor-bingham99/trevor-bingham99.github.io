## Question

I wanted to look into the Utah housing market, and see if I could identify what features/components of a house had the biggest impact on price, and which ones might be most important for prediciting the houses value. To acheive this, I collected data, detailed [here](https://trevor-bingham99.github.io/2023/12/13/Data-Collection.html), and proceed to explore the data and see what stood out to me. 

## EDA

To start out, I wanted to get a general feel for the distribution of the housing prices from what I was able to scrape via Selenium. The distribution of housing prices is fairly skewed, which was expected, as I pulled houses starting with the highest prices, so the lower prices aren't reflected very well here. But we can still get a feel for how the prices are generally spread.

From this, we see a large spike around $700,000 - $1,000,000, where most of the houses that I loaded seem to be found. This made me also want to get a feel for how many of each type of dwelling was represented in the, which we can see in the following chart.
