## Question

I wanted to look into the Utah housing market, and see if I could identify what features/components of a house had the biggest impact on price, and which ones might be most important for prediciting the houses value. To acheive this, I collected data, detailed [here](https://trevor-bingham99.github.io/2023/12/13/Data-Collection.html), and proceed to explore the data and see what stood out to me. Does the square footage of the house have a large impact? Does the type of dwelling? How does the amount of land/property that dwelling has impact the price? Where do most house prices seem to fall? All of these questions and more were in mind as I looked through the data, and I will highlight some of what I found interesting.

## EDA

To start out, I wanted to get a general feel for the distribution of the housing prices from what I was able to scrape via Selenium. The distribution of housing prices is fairly skewed, which was expected, as I pulled houses starting with the highest prices, so the lower prices aren't reflected very well here. But we can still get a feel for how the prices are generally spread.

From this, we see a large spike around $700,000 - $1,000,000, where most of the houses that I loaded seem to be found. This made me also want to get a feel for how many of each type of dwelling was represented in the, which we can see in the following chart.

Somewhat expectedly, the overwhelming majority of dwellings were single family dwellings, as that is what is most prevalent, followed by apartments and townhouse which are also rising in popularity it feels like. This made me want to look a bit into how the different types of dwellings might impact things like acres of the property, so I created a scatterplot that shows how the amount of acres and the price impact each other, colored by their type.

I found this visualization to highlight some very interesting things. We see a lot of the dwellings of the same types clusted around each other, following a similar pattern based on the type of dwelling, which does follow what I would think. It is much easier for a single family house to have more land without impacting price too much, especially compared to apartment building or condos, which seem to have steep increaes in price for little increases in acreage. This then lead me to consider what the relationship between price and the square footage of the house.

This did follow what I would think, that there is a pretty clear relationship between the price of the hosue, and how much square feet the house has. In general, there is very little variance, so the type of dwelling or other factors such as location don't seem to be very relevant to this relationship.
