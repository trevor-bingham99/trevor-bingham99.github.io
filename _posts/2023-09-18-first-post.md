## Data Visualization

In the world today, data has become a very important factor for decision making in many industries. It can be difficult to communicate this data to a wide audience, especially when the data is complex and vast. This is where data visualization comes into play, facilitating the communication of data in meaningful and impactful ways, so that your audiecne can understand and interpert the data. In data visualization, there is a wide selection of different types of visualizations and even more tools to make these visualizations. In this blog, we will be focusing on one tool, Tableau, and why it is an excellent choice for data visualization. Tableau is a very powerful tool for data visualization, and has many amazing features that make visualizing your data so much more powerful, as well as being very intuitive and easy to use and learn. We will explore the basics of these features and how to use them to build amazing visualizations throughout this blog.

## Tableau Basics

To begin, in Tableau, it breaks the data up into two overarching categories when listing the variables, discrete or continuous. There are many different variable types, from strings, to date, and to numbers, but they are grouped into whether they are discrete or continuous. Discrete variables are colored blue, and continuous are colored green to easily separate the two. Whether a variable is being used as a discrete or continuous variable can have a large impact on what the visualization looks like. For example, using a sample data set of superstore information, we can make a simple bar chart looking at the profit of each region. In this case, the Profit metric is a continuous variable, and we can see what that looks like here:
![Continuous Profit](../assests/images/cont.jpg)
Whereas changing the Profit metric to be a discrete variable chagnes the visualization to look like this:
![Discrete Profit](../assests/images/disc.jpg)
